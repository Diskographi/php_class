            as far as I understand, PHP is an extension of the Apache webserver.
            Downloading XAMPP and getting it up and running was a pain, but a good
            taste of what things in the real programming world will be like.
            I want to learn PHP to challenge myself, I want to learn it to make server-
            side rendered web applications and procress data easier. I want to be able
            to achieve CRUD operations easily and pass around data with multiple SQL
            servers. Honestly I want to pad my resume with PHP but I also want to see 
            what useful automations I can achieve with it as well. Specificlly, three
            projects I want to try are: a GUI, a Facebook application, and a 
            photo gallery.</p>";
